        <h3>Notes on Therapy #1: Taking Ideas Seriously</h3>
       <p>The effects of therapy have an annoying timeline. After a session, things are often better. I don’t feel so bad anymore. I am more in control of my life. This carries on for another day or two and then degrades. The depressive ruminations begin once more.</p>
       <p>I noticed this cycle two months into my therapy. Before I went in to speak with my therapist, I was pretty miserable, low mood, and couldn’t get around too much. Afterwards, I was pumped, smiling more, and ready to take on life. People’s thoughts bothered me less. The troubles of the universe weren’t scary; “life is a gift” and other tunes were sung in my head. Eventually, the songs became less joyful and more irritating. They’d start screeching.</p>
       <p>This cycle is frustrating. I think this frustration made me feel less positively about therapy. What would the point be if I was going to feel miserable a few days later?</p>
       <p>I told a close friend about this, and they told me to stick with it. It’s hard for me to stick with something that feels futile, but I have a lot of faith in my friend, and so I trusted them. Instead of giving up on therapy entirely, I tried to understand why this cycle was happening.</p>
       <p>I don’t think I’ve found the root cause of the cycle, but I’ve found a way to slow it down. This has come from realising that I was passively taking in the ideas from therapy. I wasn’t acting on them. I’ve been told several times that what matters is how I perceive myself. Other people’s opinions don’t matter. I nodded in agreement every time this was said, but I didn’t believe it. I grew up with the opposite being told to me, and this worked its way towards being deeply ingrained in my psyche.</p>
       <p>What was missing was an intention to take the advice from therapy seriously. I needed to adopt the identity of someone who believes in what their therapist says.   </p><p>This seems to have worked out brilliantly. I feel like I am active, not passive anymore. I don’t know if the cycle I was stuck in has disappeared, but it has halted for a bit and helped restore my faith in this whole therapy thing. </p>
